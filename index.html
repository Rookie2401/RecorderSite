        <p>I have been a Maricopa County resident for nearly 20 years. I was a prosecutor with the Maricopa County
            Attorneyâ€™s office for about 10 years and am currently in private practice. I believe that integrity and
            accountability will be the foundation to restore trust in our election system.
